1. An EEG (Electroencephalography) machine is a medical device that records the electrical activity of the brain using electrodes placed on the scalp. It detects and amplifies brain wave patterns, converting them into digital signals that can be displayed on a monitor for analysis. EEG machines are used to diagnose conditions like epilepsy, sleep disorders, brain injuries, and neurological diseases by monitoring brain wave frequencies such as delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma.
2. The PDF Data Extraction System effectively combines data extraction, processing, and reporting into a cohesive pipeline. The modular design allows for seamless integration of new data extraction rules and calculation methods, making it suitable for EEG data analysis and other similar data processing tasks.
